  <h4>
    History
  </h4>
  <p>
    The history of Darbhanga dates back to Vedic periods. The name Darbhanga is the mutated form of "Dwarbanga". That is, it is the combination of words 
	"Dwar" (Gate) and "Banga" (Bengal) meaning "Gateway of Bengal". Some scholars say that Darbhanga was named after Dar (Dwar) and Bhangaa which means
	broken gates. It is assumed that the gates of the Qila (at Qilaghat probably) were broken (by cannons or elephants) in 1326 AD when Tughlak forces 
	attacked the last independent North Indian Hindu king.
